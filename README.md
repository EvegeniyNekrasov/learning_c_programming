# 1. Optimization Flags:
Optimization flags are used to impove the performance of the compiled code. Flag speed up compilation and create more efficient programs. Some commonly
used optimizations flats include:

```
-O1, -O2, -O3, -Os
```

These flags control the level of optimization applied. 
-O1 applies basic oprimizarions, -O2, -O3 offer more advanced optimization. -Os optimizes for code size.
